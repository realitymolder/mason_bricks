# Features

## What Should Be Here?


Every Feature in the app should get its own folder. This is A feature based Project Management tool after all! ðŸ˜›

Dont worry! we have a brick for that too! ðŸ§±
Why work hard when you can work smart?

This is an atomic feature based brick, when you want to add a new feature, just ask mason to build it for you. 
Know that this stracture is also implementing the Atomic Design for further convinence. 

So, what now? 

```
mason make atomic_csr_feature
```
